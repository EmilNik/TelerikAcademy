Design pattern: Factory Method
	* Added ResponseFactory

Design pattern: Strategy
	* Added strategy pattern in the work of controllers

Design pattern: Template Method
	* Added template methods in the creating of controllers
	* and in the creating and using of responses

Design pattern: Chain of Responsibility
	* 

Design pattern: Decorator
	* Json and Content Action results with cores withouth caching... (С това се гордея най-много)

Found bugs:
	* Added missing IActionResult ReturnMe controller (renamed GetJson)
	* File not found! Added "!"
	* 

Found bottleneck:
	* The mothod FileExists. There is a recursion.

Single responsibility principle
	* Extracted methods from classes so each class has only one reponsibility.

Open/closed principle
	* Can easily add new 

Liskov substitution principle
	* Used interfaces and base classes in creating Controllers

Interface segregation principle
	* Used interfaces for creating Response factory in ResponseProvider

Dependency inversion principle
	* Used interfaces and base classes that can easily be changed. In the Action Results.
