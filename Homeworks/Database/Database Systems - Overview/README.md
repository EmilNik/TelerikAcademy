Answer following questions in Markdown format (.md file)

###1. What database models do you know?
####Hierarchical (tree)
A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data structure) for computer science: insofar as it relates to graph theory, see tree (graph theory), or also tree (set theory). Other related pages are listed below.

#####Network / graph
The Network Graph visualization supports undirected and directed graph structures. This type of visualization illuminates relationships between entities. Entities are displayed as round nodes and lines show the relationships between them. The vivid display of network nodes can highlight non-trivial data discrepancies that may be otherwise be overlooked.

#####Relational 
A relational database is a digital database whose organization is based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970. This model organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of rows and columns, with a unique key for each row.

#####Object-oriented
An object database (also object-oriented database management system) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented.

###7. What are the advantages of normalized databases?
	
###8. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
	
###9. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
	
###10. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
	
###11. What are transactions used for?
	
###12. Give an example.
	
###13. What is a NoSQL database?
	
###14. Explain the classical non-relational data models.
	
###15. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
